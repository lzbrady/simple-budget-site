## **What is Simple Budget?**

Simple Budget is a mobile budgeting app designed to help you take control of your finances. Itâ€™s hyper-focused on helping you budget proactively, without all the bells and whistles offered by other budgeting apps. The intentional simplicity and intuitive design of our app helps you dial in on spending less and saving more.

Everyone's budgeting journey is different, so Simple Budget is here to provide the flexibility required to assist your specific needs. With the Envelope Budgeting System, or Cash Stuffing, you designate specific expense categories - or your envelope - along with a predetermined amount to spend in each category. This method helps you organize and plan your expenses, laying the groundwork for consistent savings.
