### What is Simple Budget

Simple Budget is a digital tool designed to help you budget your expenses and maximize your savings. Whether you want to spend less money, save more money, or simply know where your money is going, Simple Budget can help you accomplish your goal. It is based on the Envelope Budgeting System, also known as Cash Stuffing, where you have envelopes designated to certain expense categories, as well as a pre-allotted amount to spend on that category. By organizing and pre-planning your expenses, you set yourself up to save the leftover income.

Another key aspect of Simple Budget is the act of manually logging your transactions. Although automated apps, like Mint, offer the ease of automatically pulling your bank data, they are susceptible to a “set it and forget it” mentality.

With an envelope based budgeting system, you start by categorizing your expenses. Common categories include “Groceries”, “Utilities”, “Rent/Mortgage”, and ”Entertainment”. You may even want to track your utilities separately— the difference being whether you want insights on your Utilities expenses as a whole, or for each distinct utility bill (Water, Gas, Electricity, etc). In general, creating specific and meaningful categories will help you track your expenses more accurately.
