# What Makes Simple Budget a Good Budgeting App

## **What is Simple Budget?**

Simple Budget is a mobile budgeting app designed to help you take control of your finances. It’s hyper-focused on helping you budget proactively, without all the bells and whistles offered by other budgeting apps. The intentional simplicity and intuitive design of our app helps you dial in on spending less and saving more.

Everyone's budgeting journey is different, so Simple Budget is here to provide the flexibility required to assist your specific needs. With the Envelope Budgeting System, or Cash Stuffing, you designate specific expense categories - or your envelope - along with a predetermined amount to spend in each category. This method helps you organize and plan your expenses, laying the groundwork for consistent savings.

## Proactive Budgeting

A key aspect of Simple Budget is the act of manually logging your transactions. Other automated apps may offer the ease of automatically pulling your bank data, but they leave you susceptible to a "set it and forget it" mentality. These apps track your budget as you spend, whereas you should be aiming to let your budget guide your spending. (*Check out this article for a more detailed comparison of Simple Budget vs. Mint)*.

> ***Budgeting should be proactive, not retroactive.***

On the other hand, Simple Budget gives you the tools you need to start budgeting without doing it for you. This enables you to plan your spending ahead of time and fosters greater financial awareness. While it can get tedious at times, Simple Budget’s intuitive interface makes the process simpler and quicker.

### **Create a Tailored Budgeting Plan**

### **Increase Your Savings**

Simple Budget is focused on helping you understand your expenses in a way that enables you to save more.

> Increasing your savings can happen one of two ways: start making more, or start spending less.

While making more money would be great, Simple Budget is here to help you spend less. Before working your way toward more savings, start with understanding your current expenses.
